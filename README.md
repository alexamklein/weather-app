# weather-app
This is a weather app built on VS Code using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and OpenWeather APIs.
The app is currently being hosted on Netlify at https://stellular-squirrel-4f053d.netlify.app/.
I built this app as part of an 8-week front end development workshop called SheCodes Plus taught by Matt Delac.
This is my first coding project since I started learning to code in Feb 2022 other than a previous attempt at building a webpage using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript as part of the SheCodes Basics 4-week introduction to coding workshop also taught by Matt Delac.
